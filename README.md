# TUTORING

This repo is the collection of all the work that gets done over the semester. I'm making this just so you don't have to email me assignments anymore. Plus if you ever do real programming work or want to showcase projects github is a industry standard place to do it. Best to learn it now.

## Assignment

~~-Basic control sturctures~~
~~-Object drawing app~~
- Complete the Random Name Picker
	- Add weighting/person preference to the demo code in "random_picker_demo.py"


## Python Resources

- Pygame: 
- Python 3.7: 

## How to use Github

Here are some "How To" videos:

Basically, github is a file sharing and version control manager. It's mainly used in large projects to allow multiple people to make changes to the same files, simultaneously. There is a master branch, where the main code is, and branches, where individuals will upload their own changes. The owner of a project with then merge those changes with the code in the master branch. Merging automatically finds the differences between the files in each branch, and asks the owner which changes to keep. These are called "conflicts". Once all conflicts have been resolved, github will merge the branches. I'll do a demo of all this next lesson. 

Basically all you need to know is that you will be working on your own branch, uploading all assignments to it. Every class, we will merge the previous week into master and then pull the new files that I add for the upcoming week. After a week or two you will get the hang of it and it will be second nature.
